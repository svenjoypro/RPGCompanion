				"Roll a d8 to determine which cursed Sin takes hold; 1 is Lust, 2 is Gluttony, 3 is Greed, 4 is Sloth, 5 is Wrath, 6 is Envy, and 7 is Pride.

If the person that is the subject of the curse's induced hallucinations engages the afflicted in dialogue, additional hallucinations occur.  The afflicted perceives their teeth and hair falling out and turning to dust, and also their eyes bleeding.  10 minutes after the subject of the hallucinations leaves the targets presence and line of sight, the hallucinations can start again on another person.

At the end of each of your turns you can recover your INT score by the result of any die roll as long as it doesn't exceed your INT score (e.g. your INT is 8, you chose a d12 and roll an 8 increasing it to 16, this is the best possible outcome, had you rolled higher your INT would not increase).",
				"Disadvantage on all rolls involving a body of water.",
				"Every time you make a die roll, the actual result is at the opposite side of the die (i.e  if you roll a nat 20 it becomes 1, etc.) Nat 20s gained by rolling 1s don't give critical successes, they are treated as if they were 19s.",

				"Your naked body is invisible, but only in the narrowest technical definition. You appear as a ghastly form made of skin flakes and loose hairs. Also it turns out that no number of wipes is enough after using a latrine - a thin brown film is visible unless you bathe thoroughly. To appear completely invisible requires a haircut, and approximately three hours of shaving body hair and scrubbing your skin raw. And even then, dirt sticks to your feet immediately. Guards are extremely suspicious of your power despite your explanations. Good luck.",

				"Every day the player must roll 1d4 to determine the level of severity the spell will have that day. A 4 will result in no modifiers, while a 1 reduces the player to a full crouch. Rolls of 2 and 3 are intermediary stages between full crouch and standing. While afflicted, the player gains a (0,-1,-1,-2) modifier to dexterity saving throws as well as (0,-5,-10,-15) reduced movement to no less than 5. ",

The DC is equal to the number of days they've served you (2 on the 1st morning). Upon failing the save they start plotting to kill you. On a critical failure they're willing to take significant risk to do so. If you kill them the curse starts over.",

Every time the character tries to explain his curse soapy bubbles form in his mouth rendering him unable to speak.)",

You cannot use an unarmed strike in swarm form. Once the curse is removed, you automatically reform in your normal shape, regardless of where the bees are.",
				"Roll 22d4 to determine how many members of the Crazy 88 will attack the afflicted player. The Crazy 88 share the same statistics and abilities as the Bandit Non-Player character in the Monster Manual except that they have 1 HP, 10 AC, give zero experience upon death and always now where the afflicted player is. The Crazy 88 can attack the player at any time or place of the DM's choosing and in any number from 1 to the maximum number of members of the Crazy 88 rolled, but there may only be one attack per long rest.

On a 4-5 an item moves to an unoccupied place that would make sense for it to be closest to a location 2d10 feet in a random direction.  On a 6, the item is transported 2d20 feet in a random direction.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom check reveals the item was most definitely not placed there by the player.

				"Gertrude's Trinkets:A dingy magic shop on a back street that sells surprisingly good (we're talking some top notch stuff here) magic weapons and trinkets for ridiculously low prices (half the price of normal on average). At midnight anything bought from the shop returns back to the shop magically, and the shop teleports to another remote location.",
				"The Satyr's Pact: A tavern run by a satyr who offers musicians a deal.

If they fail, they work in his tavern for a decade but can audition again for the same deal, years do add up.",

He explains that he specialises in the sale of imps, but so far the only ones he has been able to obtain (trade secrets and all) have limited lifespans. It's a mixed bag in his opinion so all the imps cost the same. Imps cost [1d20/1.33] GP each, half this if it's raining. On purchase the imp is bound to the character until the imp's unique demise. Each imp has a craving and a fear; if the character is helpful in these regards the imp's loyalty will improve. Each imp also holds a secret agenda of mischief.",

				"Murray's Theatrics: The half-elf Murray retired from the life of a wandering bard eight years ago, but still loves the trade dearly. His shop (which is really just the anteroom to his house) stocks sheet music and scripts for the lutist looking to expand her repertoire, or the troupe seeking to get ahead of the new fashion in comedies. The texts cost next to nothing - Murray remembers what it's like to travel on a performer's income. The real money comes from his younger brother, Astor, whose potions create audience-dazzling special effects.",
				"The Furrowed Brow: Esmeralda Turnbottom's mother made wards, and her mother made wards, and her mother made wards... And Esme has never been one to spoil a good tradition. The wares range from mundane (a pendant against forgetfulness, carved from gingko bark) to the specialized (ground cat's tooth to drive off harpies). Once a year, she closes up shop for a much deserved vacation, and returns with an armful of oddly specific wards. Such as \"protection from a stampede of your own cattle frightened by a thunderclap on a moonless summer night\". And yet they always get bought, and they always end up useful...",
				"The Sizzler: An exotic restaurant run by a very jovial, and very fat, half-ogre named Thog. They specialize in rare meats of all kinds and will pay well if what you have is fresh. From drake wings to spider legs, if it's fresh and serviceable they'll buy it. Their meals are renowned for being tasty and surprisingly filling, and the exotic nature of their ingredients has been known to impart certain temporary boons to the consumer. The house special is constantly changing, so get in quick before the line forms! (",
				"Nero's Place: A shop run by an aging, paranoid neurotic elf that is convinced there's a demon after him. Nero sells a wide assortment of scrying crystals, mirrors, looking glasses, and patented listening tools that he uses on a daily basis. Some of his inventions are actually helpful, like his 'Peek-around' that angles two mirrors inside a square tube to look around corners. Others are less helpful, like his 'Hearing Helm' that is basically two gramophone bells welded onto a bucket. He also sells protective charms and wards to help keep... well anything off your back, really. For the paranoid inside us all, Nero's Place is the Place for you! (",
				"Goldie's Locks: a wig shop selling enchanted wigs that are just right.",

				"Adon's Exceptional Reflection Collection: A good sized shop that sells mirrors of various shapes and sizes, run by a reclusive and eccentric old gnome named Adon. Mirrors hang from almost every surface, with some even dangling from the ceiling or the bottom of other mirrors. It is incredibly easy to get lost wandering the store, and the inside seems significantly bigger than its outside appearance belies. An observant customer will notice that some mirrors occasionally reflect fantastic locations with startling realism.",
				"Ketterman Barley's Stonecarving and Statuary: Ketterman is a stone carver of some renown, and does all kinds of stonework from bas-reliefs and fountains to statues and headstones. He's expanded his business recently by offering smaller, personal busts of the client for a reasonable sum, depending on the quality of the stone. Ketterman typically sells to the upper class, but as long as you can pay he's more than willing to work with just about any customer. But here's the catch: Ketterman is actually an accomplished diviner as well. Every time he carves an eye into his stonework he can use those eyes to scry through at any time. Ketterman uses his vast network of eyes to spy on anyone within their gaze, and if he comes across something particularly noteworthy he sells that knowledge to the highest bidder, or uses it as leverage for blackmail under his assumed alias of 'The Emerald Pool' (because his eyes are green). Ketterman has been operating for almost two decades now, and his work has traveled far across the land. Odds are his stone eyes have seen something you didn't want to be seen. So tell me friend; what are you hiding? (",

The owl is also a mechanical contraption.",
				"Ayesha's Insult Emporium: The store's name, in simple black lettering, is all that infers what lies inside.

Anyone who takes great offense to the insult is teleported out of the shop and can't re-enter.

She's a redhead with sunburnt skin and simple leather armor with a matching, battered shield. Her blade looks like shit and has been in her family for seventy generations, but a trained magical eye can see that it's a blade of dragon slaying. Not only that but the first one ever crafted, making it the mother of all other dragon slaying blades. Needless to say it is worth more gold than a king could muster. As a sidekick, Klaura travels with a small light-fairy in a lantern. The fairy can only speak sylvan (which Klaura cannot).

She left it behind because Claus, her Dire Tiger animal companion (whom can speak) came to her one night saying he was sent from the Great Stag himself. Twirly is meant for greatness, he says. And now they travel. She sits on the fancy flying carpet that hangs over his back, and he wears a snow cap (the kind with the dangly fuzz balls) that allows him to resist fire damage. Secretly (or maybe not so secretly) Claus is in love with Twirly and wasn't sent by the Great Stag, but banished by him. And Twirly gets gold sent from her family every week.",
